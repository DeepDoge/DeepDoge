### Hello, It's Shiba

I had the name Shiba way way way before it was popular. 

I code to satisfy the itching in my brain.

I code stuff, so I can stop thinking about coding them.

I'm not good at coding for others, never trust me with deadlines.

I like coding my ideas.

I have lot's of prototype projects and unfinished stuff, but will be finished.<br/>
I star my repos if they are useable. So if it has stars then its useable.
