# Hello, I'm Shiba! 👋

I had the name Shiba way way way before it was popular. 

I code to satisfy the constant itch in my brain and bring my ideas to life. Coding is my way of unleashing my thoughts so they don't consume me.

I'm not the best at coding for someone else, and deadlines can be a challenge for me. I prefer to work on my own projects, where I can let my creativity run wild.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on various projects that intrigue me.
- 🌱 I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in every direction.
- 👯 I'm not actively seeking collaborations at the moment.
- 🤔 However, I would love to find a coding friend who shares my passion.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about my projects [DeepDoge/eternis](https://github.com/DeepDoge/eternis) and [DeepDoge/master-ts](https://github.com/DeepDoge/master-ts).
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord: nomadshiba.
- 🍙 Additionally, I aspire to create my own programming or scripting language called [DeepDoge/breeze-script](https://github.com/DeepDoge/breeze-script).

## How I Started Coding

My coding journey began with a lofty goal: creating an open-world space game as a hobby. This ambition took hold of me during the summer before high school, and I've been tirelessly pursuing it ever since.

Over the years, I've restarted the project from scratch more times than I can count—perhaps 10, maybe even 20. However, with each iteration, my skills have grown, and the game has improved. The grandness of the goal has pushed me to learn various aspects of development.

Although these projects remain private repositories for now, I have documented my progress on my [Odysee Channel](https://odysee.com/@shibadev:7) and [YouTube Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHuCY46PDzE4PzwIOu4E2EQ).
