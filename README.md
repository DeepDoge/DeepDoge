### Hi there 👋

I'm Shiba, I had the name shiba way way way before it was popular.

I code what I wanna code to stop the itching in my brain.<br/>
I just need to take the stuff out of my brain, so I can stop thinking about it.<br/>
I'm not good at coding for someone else.<br/>
I'm not good with deadlines.<br/>
I just code stuff.<br/>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on "things"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "everything"
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on "nothing"

#### How I started to code

The reason why I started to code is making an open-world space game as hobby.<br/>
It happened in the summer before highschool.<br/>
I have been keep trying to make it since I first start to code.<br/>
Started from strach to coding it more than 10 times over the years maybe 20 and everytime it has gotten better.<br/>
Everytime I have learned more, and since the goal is too big, it made me learn many things.<br/>
But all of them are private repos for now.<br/>
But I have videos at [Odysee Channel](https://odysee.com/@shibadev:7) and [YouTube Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHuCY46PDzE4PzwIOu4E2EQ)
